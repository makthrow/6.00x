        A virus particle will only reproduce if it is resistant to ALL the drugs

        activeDrugs list, and the virus particle is resistant to 1 or no drugs,
        then it will NOT reproduce.

        self.resistances), the offspring has probability 1-mutProb of
        inheriting that resistance trait from the parent, and probability
        mutProb of switching that resistance trait in the offspring.

        For example, if a virus particle is resistant to guttagonol but not
        srinol, and self.mutProb is 0.1, then there is a 10% chance that
        that the offspring will lose resistance to guttagonol and a 90%
